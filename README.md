# MATLAB

## Introduction
A software used by the STEM community for computing and simulation. It can be used for various tasks in Engineering such as:
- Solving linear systems of equations
- Solving differential equations (Ordinary and Partial)
- Simulation of process systems
- Algebra computing
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

A lot of computing toolboxes are provided to do these things. MATLAB also provides an easier way to carry out tasks, using GUIs and code can be generated from the actions
taken in the GUI. This makes MATLAB an easy tool for engineers to use in their analysis.
